# Rails Scheduler

A simple form to allow users to book appointment times.

## Setup

 - Open a terminal and clone the repo locally using ```git clone```
 - Navigate to the project using ```cd rails-scheduler```
 - Install dependencies using ```bundle install```
 - Run the server using ```rails s```

## Layout

The data used to populate the form is currently hardcoded in a JSON-like object. The form_builder.js file uses that data to build the form for the user to book a time with a coach.
